# Überlebensradar or Vot Are You Sinking About?

This year I went to Kigali,
Rwanda for I want to be
a coach in teaching people thinking
like designers. I was drinking
banana beer, gin tonic, this and that
and I was living in a flat
together with three gorgeous guys
with whom I shared  so many nice
adventures in this foreign land
of lavish green hills and red sand.

Just three days later they said: Chris
you’re a coach now but hear this:
You still know nothing, be aware!
Go to work now and prepare
the design challenge for your team
of young Rwandans with the dream
to recreate their country's fate.
Don’t mess it up, please, willya mate?

Next day I met with seven nice
Rwandans which chose me likewise
to become their coach, their guide, their father
for the next three days which I would rather
call a journey of the mind,
a rollercoaster of the kind
that puts you in a constant doubt
that chews you up and spits you out
that leaves you feeling like a jerk
then we stood up and started work.

First we got to know each other
one of them was a young mother
the others students - all excited -
and quickly we became united.
Form storm norm we passed quite fast
ready to perform at last.

We scoped, researched and synthesized,
we brainstormed and we empathized.
We talked to people on the street
we even stopped a car to meet
our target group out there in place
and interviewed them face to face.

We put the user at the core
Post-Its covered walls and floor.
Diverge, converge, don’t procreate
and don’t forget to iterate.

We were visual like hell.
We got high on Edding’s smell.
We failed early and so fast
but no idea would really last
long enough to make us feel
confident to make it real.

Oh Lord of Coaching what shall I do?
I need to help my team get through
this phase of confusion called ideation!
I screamed it out in pure frustration.
A distant voice like from a dream
said: Put more sugar in your team!
So I pulled the Haribo
opened the package and let go.

And then - outside their comfort zone
the team showed me how much they’d grown.
Finally the trust payed back
one brilliant thought and we’re on track.
Where did it come from? I don’t care.
From out of nothing it was there.
Then Madlen hit the gong to chime.
A break! Thank god and we’re on time.
I rode the bus with all of you
I sang so loud: I do, I do.

Prototyping was a blast.
How quickly all the hours passed.
We took testers in the loop
remembering our target group.
Then iterate and suddenly 
it was time to get ready
for the final pitching day
at the end, to see who may
have won the competition’s prize.
We’d be so proud, that would be nice.

But here the coaches influence
will reach its final limit. Hence
I was restricted to a seat
in the audience to meet
the other coaches. Nervously
they saw the pitches. You could see
how they observed their groups on stage,
feeling trapped like in a cage. 
Some coaches were really surprised
by the ideas fantasized
from chaos turning into sense
and with creative confidence
the teams put order into things
and suddenly ideas got wings.
And in the end all made us proud
the applause well earned and loud.

Impact week came to an end
but our friendship will extend
hopefully for years to come.
All in all the downright sum
of insights that I took with me
made me greater innerly.
I know now what it means to be
a coach. I hope I found the key.

And there’s one thing that I can say:
One thing Rwanda took away
from me. A tiny little part
of my deepest inner heart.
It stays there, makes me yearn.
One day, I hope I will return
to the green hills and red sand
of Kigali, Rwanda. End.
